      <h2 class="heading-large">Version 3</h2>
      <p><a href="v3/3b/3b-signin.html">Version 3b</a></p>
      <p>An alternate design can be found below. The purpose of this is to test a "case lookup" design pattern rather than a "search" pattern. It also experiments with displaying success messages within the page content rather than at the top of the screen.</p>
      <p><a href="v3/3-signin.html">Version 3</a></p>

        <li>Added a success message, for after a document is edited</li>
        <li>Updated the success message after a document upload to play back the filename</li>
        <li>Updated the resolution of exceptions to include a success message</li>
        <li>Updated the "Date" label to be Receipt Date</li>
        <li>Updated the upload screen to remove the case reference field</li>
        <li>Updated the document type hint text on the upload and edit screen - to prompt for "e.g. Correspondence" rather than "e.g. Grant Letter"</li>
        <li>Updated all pages to use the BETA banner rather than ALPHA</li>
        <li>Updated the field labels on the signin page to be "Username" rather than "Enter your username" - to be consistent with the real system.</li>
        <li>Standardised the "reference number" and "case reference number" language to be "case reference".</li>
      </ul>
